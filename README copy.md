## Description
Research has shown the importance of educating children on emotions. Understanding emotions helps children regulate their responses to intense emotions and teaches empathy. This project aims to develop an engaging and educational game prototype that helps children identify and name emotions, recognise relevant physical sensations, and validate and accept them. The game will also include research and evidence-backed coping mechanisms.
